          <h4>MY LOVE FOR TECHNOLOGY</h4>
          <p>
            When I think of how much I love technology, what redealy comes to my
            mind is the words of
            <i>Andrew Arce (Consulting manager at Deloitte)</i>
          </p>
          <div class="block-quote">
            <blockquote>
              <i
                >"Technology has the ability to impact lives at a level and
                scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind.
                The idea that something I create can impact someone accross the
                world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for
                Technology"</i
              >
            </blockquote>
          </div>
          <p>
            I couldn't agree more. To think that I can use technology to create
            solutions that can help solve world problems thereby impacting the
            lives of people make me love it even more.

          <h4>WHAT I HAVE LEARNT SO FAR</h4>
          <p>
            <strong><i>I have learnt the following: </i></strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to use Github in colaborating wiht others.</li>
            <li>
              I have learnt commandline basics and I can use the command line
              like a pro now ðŸ˜ƒ
            </li>
            <li>
              I have learnt that HTML is used in building the structure of a
              webpage though it is not a programming language as some people
              think.
            </li>
            <li>
              I Also learnt that CSS which stands for cascading style sheets is
              used in beutifying our webpage
            </li>
            <li>
              I have made practical application of my knowledge by building
              basic HTML and CSS projects
            </li>
            <li>
              I also learnt that Git and Github are not the same as some people
              think. While Git is a version control system that lets you manage
              and keep track of your source code history, Github on the
              otherhand is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage
              Git repositories
            </li>

            <h4>IMPORTANCE OF CSS</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                It helps in beutifying our web page thereby creating a better
                user experience
              </li>
              <li>It is easy to maintain and update</li>
              <li>It is a lightweiht code</li>
              <li>
                By using CSS, the layout of a web page is better controled
              </li>
              <li>It enhances search engine optimization</li>
